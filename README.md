I have used the MVC framework
I have made the denormalized db 
I have implemented a different technique for pulling data (used laravel relationships).
There are many alternative logics that can be used but I tried to use the most simple logic.
If you want some improvement in any of the things (alternative logic) I can easily modify this.
I have added comments in my controller so that it is easily understandable

My js/ajax logic is placed in public/js/quiz.js file
